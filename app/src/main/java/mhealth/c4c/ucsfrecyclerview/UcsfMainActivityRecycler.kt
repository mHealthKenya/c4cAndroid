Individuals who are both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and HBeAg positive have more viruses in their blood and are more likely to transmit HBV.<br/><br/>\n<b>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) </b>: Based on limited studies, the estimated risk for infection after a needle-stick or cut exposure to HCV-infected blood is approximately 1.8%. The risk following a blood splash is unknown but is believed to be very small; however, HCV infection from such an exposure has been reported.<br/><br/>\n<b>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</b>: The average risk for HIV infection after a needlestick or cut exposure to HlV-infected blood is 0.3% (about 1 in 300). Stated another way, 99.7% of needlestick/cut exposures to HIV-contaminated blood do not lead to infection. The risk after exposure of the eye, nose, or mouth to HIV-infected blood is estimated to be, on average, 0.1% (1 in 1,000).The risk after exposure of the skin to HlV-infected blood is estimated to be less than 0.1%. A small amount of blood on intact skin probably poses no risk at all. There have been no documented cases of HIV transmission due to an exposure involving a small amount of blood on intact skin (a few drops of blood on skin for a short period of time). The risk may be higher if the skin is damaged (for example, by a recent cut), if the contact involves a large area of skin, or if the contact is prolonged.<br/><br/>").toString()))
